    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>An ambitious and versatile professional with a diverse background in retail management, logistics, healthcare inventory management, and pharmacy operations. As an Assistant Grocery Manager and interim Liquor Manager at Kroger, I honed leadership skills by managing daily operations, overseeing inventory, and training staff to ensure smooth workflows, while maintaining customer satisfaction in high-demand departments. My role required balancing multiple responsibilities, from managing product displays to supporting sales growth and ensuring compliance with regulations in the liquor department.
At Nebraska Medical Center, I gained valuable experience as an Automation & Inventory Technician. I was responsible for monitoring and maintaining automated systems that handled medical supplies and medications. This role deepened my technical knowledge and attention to detail as I ensured that critical inventory levels were met and processes ran smoothly to support healthcare operations.

As a Pharmacist Apprentice at Wal-Greens, I supported pharmaceutical operations by assisting with inventory management, customer service, and daily pharmacy tasks. This experience furthered my understanding of healthcare workflows, pharmaceutical regulations, and customer care.
In addition to my diverse work experience, I have also worked as a contracted Computer Engineer, applying my technical knowledge to design, troubleshoot, and optimize systems for clients, further enhancing my skills in software development, automation, and problem-solving.
Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, I am leveraging my technical education and practical work experience to develop expertise in system optimization, automation, and problem-solving across diverse industries.</p>
